# Shawn Mastandrea's First CS193 Homework

What do I like about CS193? Well...

- It's a student-run class, so there is a lot less pressure and a lot more understanding of what exactly the students need.
- The Ed Discussion page is a great place to get help quickly from TA's who know their stuff.
- The lectures contain a lot more friendly commentary and gen-Z language because of who is teaching. It is a much more welcoming class than a lot of larger lectures.

Thanks for reading my intro, and don't get too attached to anything I say.
